# SATSolver

## Usage
You need C++17. This readme assumes you are using clang, it probably works with g++17 as well (replace clang++ with g++ in commands).

Compile with `clang++ -std=c++17 -O3 solver.cpp -o SATSolver`
Test with `./SATSolver < input.txt > output.txt`

To try our test case, do `./SATSolver < problem.txt > solution.out`
